/**
 * Moves events from the outbox table to Kafka. Not a primary adapter: it calls
 * no use case and decides nothing about payments. It is the second half of the
 * PaymentEventPort adapter, the half that runs after the transaction.
 *
 * A row is marked published only after the broker acknowledged it. A crash in
 * between sends it again on the next run: at least once, never lost.
 *
 * Each run is a new trace: nothing called it. Each send joins the trace of the
 * change that recorded the event instead (docs/episodes/bonus-05), through a
 * span whose parent is the traceparent stored in the row.
 *
 * Every instance runs a relay (docs/episodes/bonus-07). Each batch is one
 * transaction that claims its rows (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED), so two
 * relays never send the same row while both are alive, and only each payment's
 * oldest unpublished event is claimed, so one payment's events stay in order
 * whichever relay sends them.
